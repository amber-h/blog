Nothing like starting the year with gadgets, glam and good food at [CES](http://www.cesweb.org/) in Las Vegas where over 150,000 attendees from over 150 countries around the world get together to showcase and check out the most innovative upcoming technologies.

Audi impressed its viewers on the opening night of CES during their keynote at the Cosmopolitan hotel with speaker Kunal Nayyar of "The Big Bang Theory".

They showcased their _**autonomous cars**_, of which the [Audi A7](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbbCaSvQXKU) is seen in the image below. Kunal Nayyar is holding the "brain" of the self-driving car which fits on a circuit board smaller than an iPad.

Another highlight of the Audi keynote were the new _**laser-powered headlights**_. These headlights have a range of 500 meters and can detect oncoming traffic to adjust the power appropriately.

There were no shortage of TVs being showcased. In the main hall of CES you could find _**4K (Samsung even had an 8K TV on display), curved, OLED, bendable and 3D UHD TVs**_.

_**Samsung**_ was also showcasing a _**dual-view OLED TV**_ allowing viewers to look at the screen and watch two different programs simultaneously. The viewers need to wear 3D glasses and sit either to the left or the right of the screen depending on what they want to watch. No more fighting over which shows to watch! 

Another surprise by both Samsung and LG were their _**bendable TVs**_, which, with the push of a button, literally morphed the TV from flat screen to curved.

LG showed off their large concept _**touch screen mirror**_ and _**transparent displays**_. Imagine the contents of your smartphone being displayed on your mirror as you get ready in the morning, voice activated to access your schedule, emails, weather ect. They also demo'd the mirror and transparent displays to be used in stores, allowing customers to browse through catalogues and learn more about products.

Toshiba was displaying their _**concept 5-in-1 PC**_ which can be used in: 1. Laptop mode 2. Canvas mode 3. Tablet Mode 4. Presentation / TV Mode and 5. Convertible Tablet Mode. 

The concept PC has a detachable keyboard which can be used wirelessly. It also has a rotating base which can be used as a stand in either tablet or PC mode.

No specs were provided since it is still purely a concept, so at this point it is hard to say how useful it might be. What do you think?

There was no surprise to see the _**Oculus Rift**_ augmented reality gaming goggles amongst all the gadgets at CES. A huge crowd lined up to demo the system. Check out more details [here](http://www.oculusvr.com/) if you haven't seen it yet.

One of my favorites was the [Intel Edison](http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/do-it-yourself/edison.html), a _**computer the size of an SD card**_. Intel demo'd the use of Edison as a monitoring system by attaching sensors to a babies outfit, which then graphically displayed the information on a coffee mug using LEDs. 

Edison has built-in Wi-Fi as well as Bluetooth Low Energy capabilities. It uses flash storage and can be used as an SD card in your devices. For developers, it will be an interesting alternative to similar but larger devices such as the [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org) and [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/) once it is released.

Intels opening keynote also hit home for me when they announced they are now [conflict mineral](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aF-sJgcoY20) free. This means they are no longer producing chips and hardware with minerals originating from the Congo where the minerals are mined under conditions of human rights abuse and armed conflict. This is a big move by Intel, hoping others will follow.

Last but not least, you can't go to a tech conference without high-tech massage chairs. (This one is mostly here for entertainment, but also, note the male to female ratio in this photo, a good representation of what it was like at the conference).

PS. If you're in Vegas, check out the unlimited champagne [Bacchanal Buffet](http://www.caesarspalace.com/restaurants/bacchanal-buffet.html#.UtM3KGRDt9Q) at Ceasars Palace. Show up about an hour before you want to eat to grab a ticket to reserve a table. Oh, and don't plan on doing any shopping / trying on fitted clothing afterwards (unless you have much better self control than I do) .
